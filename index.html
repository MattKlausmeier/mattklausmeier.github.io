	<p>Welcome! If you're here, you're either looking for my <a href="/sermons/">sermons</a>, my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattklausmeier">LinkedIn</a>, that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/46850/">game</a> I made (available on Steam), or maybe you just have the same name as me and Googled yourself. (I find that fascinating and I'd love to meet you! There's not a lot of Matt Klausmeiers; feel free to introduce yourself.)</p>
	<p>Anyways, if you're trying to get in touch with me, for my email, you can type my full first name (not just "Matt"), then a dot, then my last name, and send it to gmail.  Or try my incredibly uninteresting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MattKlausmeier">Facebook page</a>.  Anyways, hope you found what you were looking for!</p>
	<p>-Matt</p>
